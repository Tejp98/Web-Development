Description:  Made a website that takes email address to signup for a newsletter. Used mailchimp API and consequently got to learn how to use a API in Node js. Made the frontend with the help of Bootstrap. Finally, deployed the website using heroku instead of Github pages as the website included server side code not only static content. Also made the API key hidden before pushing to the public repository using environment variables. Configured these environment variables while deploying to heroku.
